# CoinmarketcapTracker
A simple C# .NET library and console app that retrieves the rating of top cryptocurrencies from Coinmarketcap and it allows storing it on a disk. The code makes it possible to download both latest and historical listings of crypto. 

Includes a skeleton of a very basic framework for rules testing on the data (not complete yet).
